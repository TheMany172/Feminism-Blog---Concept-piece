            <div class="article-body">
                <p>The gender pay gap remains a persistent issue in workplaces worldwide, with women earning less than men for similar work. This comprehensive analysis explores the current state of the pay gap, its causes, and potential solutions.</p>

                <h2>Current Statistics</h2>
                <p>According to the latest data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Women earn approximately 82 cents for every dollar earned by men in the United States</li>
                    <li>The gap widens for women of color (Black women earn 63 cents, Latina women 55 cents)</li>
                    <li>Women with advanced degrees still face significant pay disparities</li>
                    <li>The gap increases as women age and progress in their careers</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Factors Contributing to the Pay Gap</h2>
                <h3>1. Occupational Segregation</h3>
                <p>Women are often concentrated in lower-paying industries and roles, while male-dominated fields typically offer higher salaries. This occupational segregation accounts for a significant portion of the pay gap.</p>

                <h3>2. Motherhood Penalty</h3>
                <p>Research shows that women face a "motherhood penalty" in the workplace, while men often receive a "fatherhood bonus." This bias affects hiring, promotions, and salary decisions.</p>

                <h3>3. Negotiation and Self-Advocacy</h3>
                <p>Studies indicate that women are less likely to negotiate their salaries and may face backlash when they do, while men are more likely to negotiate and receive positive outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Women's Economic Security</h2>
                <p>The pay gap has far-reaching consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced lifetime earnings</li>
                    <li>Lower retirement savings</li>
                    <li>Greater financial vulnerability</li>
                    <li>Limited economic independence</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Solutions and Progress</h2>
                <h3>Legislative Efforts</h3>
                <p>Several countries have implemented measures to address the pay gap:</p>

                    <li>Equal pay legislation</li>
                    <li>Mandatory reporting requirements</li>
                    <li>Anti-discrimination protections</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Corporate Initiatives</h3>
                <p>Progressive companies are taking action through:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
