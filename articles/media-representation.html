            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The media plays a powerful role in shaping our perceptions of beauty and body image. From traditional media to social media platforms, the representation of bodies has a significant impact on how we view ourselves and others.</p>

                <h2>The Evolution of Media Representation</h2>
                <p>Historically, media representation has been limited and often exclusionary. Mainstream media has traditionally promoted a narrow standard of beauty that excludes many body types, races, and identities. However, recent years have seen a shift towards more inclusive representation.</p>

                <h2>Current State of Media Representation</h2>
                <p>While progress has been made, there's still much work to be done. Current media representation often:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tokenizes diverse bodies rather than normalizing them</li>
                    <li>Fails to represent intersectional identities</li>
                    <li>Continues to promote unrealistic beauty standards</li>
                    <li>Lacks authentic representation of different body types</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Impact of Social Media</h2>
                <p>Social media has both positive and negative impacts on body image:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides platforms for body-positive activism</li>
                    <li>Enables community building and support</li>
                    <li>Can perpetuate unrealistic standards through filters and editing</li>
                    <li>Creates pressure to present an idealized version of oneself</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Moving Towards Better Representation</h2>
                <p>To improve media representation, we need to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Support diverse creators and content</li>
                    <li>Challenge harmful beauty standards</li>
                    <li>Demand authentic representation from media companies</li>
                    <li>Create and share content that celebrates all bodies</li>
                    <li>Hold media accountable for harmful representations</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Role of Consumers</h2>
                <p>As consumers, we have the power to influence media representation through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supporting diverse content creators</li>
                    <li>Engaging with body-positive content</li>
                    <li>Providing feedback to media companies</li>
                    <li>Creating and sharing inclusive content</li>
                    <li>Supporting brands that promote diversity</li>
                </ul>
