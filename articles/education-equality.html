                <p>Education is a fundamental human right, yet millions of girls worldwide still face barriers to accessing quality education. This article examines the current state of girls' education globally and explores solutions for achieving true educational equality.</p>

                <h2>Current State of Girls' Education</h2>
                <p>According to UNESCO's latest data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>132 million girls worldwide are out of school</li>
                    <li>Girls are more likely than boys to never enter school</li>
                    <li>In some regions, less than 50% of girls complete secondary education</li>
                    <li>COVID-19 has disproportionately affected girls' education</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Barriers to Girls' Education</h2>
                <h3>1. Cultural and Social Norms</h3>
                <p>Traditional gender roles and cultural expectations often prioritize boys' education over girls'. Early marriage, household responsibilities, and gender stereotypes can prevent girls from attending school.</p>

                <h3>2. Economic Barriers</h3>
                <p>Poverty and economic hardship can force families to choose between educating their sons or daughters, often favoring boys due to traditional gender roles.</p>

                <h3>3. Safety and Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>Many girls face safety concerns on their way to school or within school premises. Lack of proper sanitation facilities can also prevent girls from attending school during menstruation.</p>

                <h2>Impact of Educational Inequality</h2>
                <p>The consequences of educational inequality are far-reaching:</p>

                    <li>Higher rates of child marriage</li>
                    <li>Reduced political participation</li>
                    <li>Intergenerational poverty</li>
                    <li>Health disparities</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Success Stories and Solutions</h2>
                <h3>Community-Based Initiatives</h3>
                <p>Successful programs often involve:</p>

                    <li>Scholarship programs for girls</li>
                    <li>Safe transportation to schools</li>
                    <li>Menstrual health management support</li>
                    <li>Parent education programs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Policy and Advocacy</h3>
                <p>Effective policy measures include:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Monitoring and evaluation systems</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
                <p>Individuals and organizations can contribute through:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supporting education initiatives</li>
